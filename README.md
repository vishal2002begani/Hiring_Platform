![Dashboard View](./public/images/Dashborad.png)

## Overview

The **Job Management Dashboard** is a web application built with React and Material-UI that allows users to manage job roles for an organization. The app includes features to add, view, edit, and delete job roles, each with descriptions and applicant counts. Data is stored in local storage, ensuring persistence across browser sessions.

## Features

- **Add New Job Role**: Add new job roles with descriptions and an initial count of applicants.
- **View Job Roles**: Display all job roles with descriptions and number of applicants.
- **Edit Job Role**: Modify the name and description of an existing job role.
- **Delete Job Role**: Remove a job role from the list.
- **Local Storage Persistence**: Data is stored in local storage, maintaining changes across browser sessions.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Material-UI**: UI library providing Material Design components for faster and more efficient development.
- **localStorage**: Used to store job role data persistently within the browser.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will automatically reload if you make changes to the code.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.\
See more about testing in the [React documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs/testing.html).

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production in the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode, optimizing for best performance.

The build is minified, and the filenames include hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

### `npm run eject`

**Note**: This is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!

If you want full control over the build configuration, you can `eject` the app, which will copy all configuration files and dependencies into your project.
